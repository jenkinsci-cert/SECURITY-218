**This mitigation is obsolete as of Jenkins 2.54.**
If you have installed a 2.54+ version of Jenkins anew, the Remoting-based CLI is disabled out of the box.
If you installed an older version of Jenkins and upgraded to 2.54+,
you will be prompted by an administrative monitor
to go to **Configure Global Security** and disable the Remoting-based CLI.
In either case, the following workarounds are unnecessary.

Or, if you are using Jenkins 2.32+ or 2.19.3+
(as mentioned in the [security advisory of 2016 Nov 16](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2016-11-16/)),
but older than 2.54, you may simply use the startup switch: `-Djenkins.CLI.disabled=true`

# Mitigation for unauthenticated remote code execution via CLI

> NOTE: This script was originally published in **November 2015** to fix the **SECURITY-218** zero-day vulnerability. It can also be applied as a workaround for the **SECURITY-360** zero-day vulnerability published in **November 2016**.

[This script](cli-shutdown.groovy) can be used to shut down CLI subsystem of Jenkins to protect Jenkins from a known vulnerability.

When run from the Groovy script console (`/script`), this shuts down CLI subsystem of a running Jenkins without needing a restart.

When placed in `$JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/cli-shutdown.groovy` it makes sure the protection stays in place after master restart.

To see if the mitigation is successfully applied, try running `java -jar cli.jar -s $JENKINS_URL` with [cli.jar](http://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/org/jenkins-ci/main/cli/1.636/cli-1.636-jar-with-dependencies.jar) and make sure you get `EOFException` like the following:

```
java.io.EOFException

# FAQ
### How do I interpret the output from this script?
It doesn't mean anything useful. So please ignore the output. See above for how to verify that the mitigation took place. To be safe, please also perform the verification again if you restart Jenkins.

### Does this affect the REST API?
No.

### What vulnerability is this a fix for?
Originally this was developed in November 2015 as a workaround for the SECURITY-218 zero-day remote code execution vulnerability. Releases with a fix were published on November 11, 2015.

On November 11, 2016, another zero-day remote code execution vulnerability (SECURITY-360) used a similar technique, and this workaround was effective here as well.
